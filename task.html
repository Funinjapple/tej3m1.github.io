<H2>TEJ3M1-01 Unit 1 Assignment 3: Separating Structure and Presentation with XHTML and 
CSS</H2>
<P><PRE><H3><B>Due Date:  Thursday, September 22, 2016   Marks:  APPL:  /30</B></H3></PRE>
<P></P>
<P>The aim of this assignment is to learn how structure and presentation of web 
content can be separated using XHTML and CSS.</P>
<HR>
<DIV class=task>
<H2>Task 1: Learn XHTML and CSS</H2>
<P>Learn to write eXtensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) and Cascading 
Style Sheets (CSS) by following the tutorials at 
<A 
href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/">http://www.w3schools.com/css/</A>.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=task>
<H2>Task 2: Create a Web Page [ /20]</H2>
<P>Create a web page on some topic that you know something about. Also create 
an external style sheet to give web browsers hints about how you prefer the 
pages to be rendered. The files should fulfill the following criteria:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Use strict XHTML.
  <LI>Comment your code appropriately. 
  <LI>Use at least one image and one table. 
  <LI>Use meta tags to describe the content of your pages. 
  <LI>Define at least three different CSS classes in your style sheet and 
  demonstrate their use in the XHTML pages. 
  <LI>Read up on CSS
 <A  href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp">pseudo-classes</A> 
  and define two classes of hyperlinks: one where the links turn green when the 
  mouse hovers over them and one where the links turn red. 
  <LI><U>Testing with Multiple HTTP Clients.</U> Beginning with this assignment, 
  you are expected to test your work with at least two different HTTP clients 
  (Web browsers). Suggestions for a second HTTP client (I assume you already are 
  using Microsoft Internet Explorer) are: <A 
  href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</A> , <A 
  href="http://www.opera.com//">Opera</A> , <A 
  href="http://browser.netscape.com/ns8///">Netscape</A> , <A 
  href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya///">Amaya</A>
  You can get to Firefox through:  q: utilities  </LI></UL>
<P>Make sure you separate structure and presentation as much as possible. Use 
indentation to make sure your code is readable and make sure you have all the 
closing tags in place.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=task>
<H2>Task 3: Validate Your Pages [ /10]</H2>
<P>Use the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) XHTML validation service at <A 
href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</A> to check that your 
page conforms to the XHTML and CSS standards. You can either upload the page to 
the W3C or put it online and type the URL into the W3C's validator 
form.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=task>
<P>You will run your program for the teacher on the due date. Be prepared 
to verbally explain to the teacher any aspect of your programming code.</P>
<P>Marks will be allocated for clear separation of structure and presentation 
and for generally good programming style, i.e., adequate use of tags, 
indentation, etc.</P></DIV>
